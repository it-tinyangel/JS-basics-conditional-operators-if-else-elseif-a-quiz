# Module 2. JS Programming Basics. Lesson 2. Task 1

# A quiz

The user is prompted to pass the test (in the console and message window).

10 quiz questions and their answers have been created: answer 1, answer 2, etc. and a score counter (score = 0;). Each question is asked using the prompt() function, the answers are checked with the conditional if statement, if the answer is correct, one is added to the points. To avoid case difference errors, the toLowerCase() method is used to convert all incoming responses to lower case.

At the end of the quiz, the statistics of the number of correct answers and the level of knowledge in relation to the scored points are recorded in the console (v.1) and the notification window (v.2).
